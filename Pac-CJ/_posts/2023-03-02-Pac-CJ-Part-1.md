# Pac-CJ - Road Data

Or, Pac-CJ - Road Data - The Thing that Turns Out to be a Huge Pain in the Ass.

Turns out, good road data for people just trying to play irl pacman is actually really hard to find. I got my data from [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org), but I couldn't download exactly what I wanted from there so I used [bbbike](https://extract.bbbike.org/) to download the area around Moscow. This data is really quite overly detailed, it goes so far as to include the areas in parking lots. 

![Image couldn't load I guess?](images/Pac-CJ/ParkingLots.png){: width="100%" }

Luckily these were all tagged as "service" roads so they were easy to delete in bulk.

For the viewing and manipulation of this data I used [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), a really great piece of free software. The red lines are the roads in the data, the background map I got from SOMEWHERE.

Honestly the rest of this post is just me talking about more peculiarities of the data and trying to fix them
